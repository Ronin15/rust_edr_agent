# EDR Agent (Test Project)

> **⚠️ Test/Learning Project**: This is a test implementation of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent built for learning and experimentation purposes. It is not intended for production use.....yet..

A high-performance EDR agent prototype written in Rust, demonstrating modern security monitoring concepts and Rust async programming patterns.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project serves as a:
- Learning exercise for Rust systems programming
- Prototype for EDR agent architecture design
- Demonstration of async/await patterns in security tools
- Test bed for cross-platform monitoring capabilities

## 🚀 Features (In Development)

- **Process Monitoring**: Track process creation, termination, and behavior changes
- **File System Monitoring**: Real-time file system event detection with file hashing
- **Network Monitoring**: Network connection and DNS query tracking
- **Registry Monitoring**: Windows registry change detection (currently support is planned)
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **High Performance**: ~80 MB memory footprint with 90%+ event compression
- **Configurable**: YAML-based configuration with reasonable defaults

## 📋 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Core Architecture**: Agent orchestration, lifecycle management, async event processing
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based config with validation and defaults
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time process creation/termination/modification tracking with CPU/memory metrics
- **File System Monitoring**: Live file change detection with hash calculation and metadata extraction
- **Network Monitoring**: Connection tracking via netstat/lsof with protocol and process mapping
- **Event System**: Unified event format, batching, and structured data
- **Storage Management**: Compressed storage (90%+ compression), automatic cleanup, retention policies
- **Logging**: Structured logging with file rotation and console output
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 🔄 Partially Implemented
- **Registry Monitoring**: Basic structure exists but Windows-only and needs testing
- **Network Manager**: Stub implementation for remote data transmission

### 📋 Planned/Missing
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration tests
- **Security Hardening**: Input validation, privilege separation
- **Performance Optimization**: High-throughput scenarios
- **Advanced Analytics**: Event correlation, threat detection

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Cargo

### Building
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd edr_agent
cargo build
```

### Running
```bash
# Run with default configuration
cargo run

# Or build release version
cargo build --release
./target/release/edr-agent
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize the agent behavior:
- Adjust collection intervals
- Enable/disable specific collectors
- Configure storage settings (compression, retention)
- Adjust logging levels and file rotation

### Core Components

- **Agent Core**: Orchestrates all components and manages lifecycle
- **Collectors**: Modular monitoring components (process, file, network, registry)
- **Events**: Unified event format and processing pipeline
- **Storage**: Local event storage with configurable retention
- **Network**: Remote server communication (stub)
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration management

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Not Production Ready**: This is a test project and lacks many security and reliability features required for production use
- **Limited Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite is not yet implemented
- **Network Manager**: Remote data transmission is stub implementation only
- **Registry Monitoring**: Windows-only and requires testing
- **No Security Hardening**: Missing privilege separation, input validation, etc.
- **Performance**: Not optimized for high-throughput environments
- **Runtime Error**: Currently has a config deserialization issue that needs fixing
