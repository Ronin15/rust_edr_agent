# EDR Agent (Test Project)

> **⚠️ Test/Learning Project**: This is a test implementation of an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent built for learning and experimentation purposes. It is not intended for production use.

A high-performance EDR agent prototype written in Rust, demonstrating modern security monitoring concepts and Rust async programming patterns.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project serves as a:
- Learning exercise for Rust systems programming
- Prototype for EDR agent architecture design
- Demonstration of async/await patterns in security tools
- Test bed for cross-platform monitoring capabilities

## 🚀 Features (In Development)

- **Process Monitoring**: Track process creation, termination, and behavior changes
- **File System Monitoring**: Real-time file system event detection with file hashing
- **Network Monitoring**: Network connection and DNS query tracking
- **Registry Monitoring**: Windows registry change detection (currently support is planned)
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **High Performance**: ~80 MB memory footprint with 90%+ event compression
- **Configurable**: YAML-based configuration with reasonable defaults

## 📋 Current Status

- ✅ Core architecture implemented
- ✅ Configuration system working
- ✅ Process monitoring functional
- ✅ Real-time file system monitoring with hashing
- ✅ Network connection monitoring
- ✅ Event system and compressed storage
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- 🔄 Registry monitoring (Windows only, planned)
- 📋 Testing framework (planned)
- ✅ Documentation completed

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Cargo

### Building
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd edr_agent
cargo build
```

### Running
```bash
# Run with default configuration
cargo run

# Or build release version
cargo build --release
./target/release/edr-agent
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize the agent behavior:
- Adjust collection intervals
- Enable/disable specific collectors
- Configure storage settings (compression, retention)
- Adjust logging levels and file rotation

### Quick Test Run
```bash
# 1. Build and run
cargo build
RUST_LOG=info cargo run

# 2. In another terminal, generate activity
ls -la && ps aux

# 3. Check results
ls data/          # Event files
tail logs/*.log   # Log output
```

### Core Components

- **Agent Core**: Orchestrates all components and manages lifecycle
- **Collectors**: Modular monitoring components (process, file, network, registry)
- **Events**: Unified event format and processing pipeline
- **Storage**: Local event storage with configurable retention
- **Network**: Remote server communication (stub)
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration management

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Not Production Ready**: This is a test project and lacks many security and reliability features required for production use
- **Limited Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite is not yet implemented
- **Incomplete Features**: Many collectors are stub implementations
- **No Security Hardening**: Missing privilege separation, input validation, etc.
- **Performance**: Not optimized for high-throughput environments
