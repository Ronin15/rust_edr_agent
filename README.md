### üéØ Behavioral Detection Engine (NEW)
- **üîç Cross-Platform Threat Detection**: Real-time detection of process injection, suspicious shell execution, and malicious file operations
- **üß† Context-Aware Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk adjustment based on process location, system context, and expected behavior
- **‚ö° Frequency-Based Alert Suppression**: Progressive risk reduction for repeated alerts to minimize false positives
- **üõ°Ô∏è System Process Context Recognition**: Baseline understanding of legitimate system processes (systemd, init, etc.)
- **üìä Platform-Adaptive Rules**: Automatically applies Linux, Windows, or macOS-specific detection patterns

## üìã Implementation Status

**‚úÖ Fully Implemented**: Core architecture, process/file/network monitoring, behavioral detection, storage with compression, cross-platform support

**üîÑ Partial**: Network manager (stub), testing framework

**üìã Planned**: Security hardening, advanced analytics

üìñ **Complete status in [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Cargo

### Building
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd edr_agent
cargo build
```

### Running
```bash
# Run with default configuration
cargo run

# Or build release version
cargo build --release
./target/release/edr-agent
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize the agent behavior:
- Adjust collection intervals
- Enable/disable specific collectors
- Configure storage settings (compression, retention)
- Adjust logging levels and file rotation

./target/release/edr-agent

# 2. Watch for security alerts in real-time
tail -f logs/edr-agent.log | grep "SECURITY ALERT"

# 3. View detection statistics
grep "SECURITY ALERT" logs/edr-agent.log | wc -l
grep -o "Risk: [0-9.]*" logs/edr-agent.log | sort | uniq -c
```

```bash
# Test Linux-specific detection capabilities
cargo run --bin test_linux_detection

# This test validates:
# ‚Ä¢ Linux process injection detection (ptrace, .so attacks)
# ‚Ä¢ System process context recognition (systemd, init)
# ‚Ä¢ Suspicious path detection (/tmp, /dev/shm, browser cache)
# ‚Ä¢ Shell execution monitoring
# ‚Ä¢ Command line pattern analysis
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Not Production Ready**: This is a test project and lacks many security and reliability features required for production use
- **Limited Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite is not yet implemented
- **Network Manager**: Remote data transmission is stub implementation only
- **Registry Monitoring**: Windows-only and requires testing
- **No Security Hardening**: Missing privilege separation, input validation, etc.
- **Performance**: Not optimized for high-throughput environments
- **Runtime Error**: Currently has a config deserialization issue that needs fixing
