# DNS Anomaly Detection Engine

## Overview

The EDR Agent features a sophisticated DNS Anomaly Detection Engine that monitors DNS traffic for suspicious patterns, malicious domains, and potential threats. This engine provides real-time detection of DNS-based attacks including DNS tunneling, data exfiltration, C2 communication, and high-frequency query attacks.

## üöÄ Features

### üîç Real-Time DNS Threat Detection
- **High-Frequency Query Detection**: Identifies rapid DNS query patterns that may indicate DDoS, brute force, or automated attacks
- **Suspicious Domain Analysis**: Detects malicious domain patterns, DGAs, and known threat indicators
- **DNS Tunneling Detection**: Identifies data exfiltration and command-and-control communication via DNS
- **Data Exfiltration Monitoring**: Tracks large data transfers through DNS responses
- **Beaconing Pattern Recognition**: Detects regular DNS queries that may indicate C2 communication

### üåê Comprehensive DNS Monitoring
- **Multiple DNS Protocols**: Monitors standard DNS (port 53), DNS over TLS (853), DNS over HTTPS (443), and DNS over QUIC
- **DNS Provider Recognition**: Identifies queries to major DNS providers (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS, AdGuard)
- **Custom DNS Port Detection**: Monitors non-standard DNS ports and configurations
- **Process Attribution**: Links DNS queries to specific processes for context

### üêß Advanced EDR Integration
- **System DNS Log Parsing**: Extracts domain information from systemd-resolved and dnsmasq logs
- **Process Command Line Analysis**: Extracts domain names from process arguments (curl, wget, browsers)
- **High-Throughput Optimization**: Non-blocking DNS monitoring for busy networks
- **Domain Validation**: RFC-compliant domain name validation and parsing

## üìä Detection Capabilities

### Threat Detection Rules

#### High-Frequency DNS Queries
```yaml
# Default threshold: 5 queries per minute
dns_anomaly:
  max_queries_per_minute: 5
  max_queries_per_hour: 1000
  max_unique_domains_per_hour: 500
```

**Detected Patterns:**
- Rapid DNS queries from single process
- Automated query generation

#### Suspicious Domain Patterns
```yaml
suspicious_domain_patterns:
  - ".*\\.onion$"              # Tor domains
  - ".*[0-9]{10,}.*"           # Long numeric sequences
  - ".*[a-fA-F0-9]{32,}.*"     # Long hex sequences
  - ".*[A-Za-z0-9+/]{20,}=*.*" # Base64 patterns
  - ".*\\.tk$"                 # Free TLDs often used maliciously
  - ".*\\.ml$"
  - ".*\\.ga$"
  - ".*\\.cf$"
  - ".*dyndns\\..*"            # Dynamic DNS

- **Frequency Analysis**: Detects consistent high-frequency queries to specific domains

#### Command & Control Detection
```yaml
known_c2_domains:
  - "malware-c2.example.com"
  - "evil-domain.tk"
  - "suspicious-beacon.ml"
```

**Detected Patterns:**
- Queries to known malicious domains
- Regular beaconing intervals
- Consistent query patterns

#### Data Exfiltration Detection
```yaml
data_exfiltration_threshold_mb_per_hour: 1  # 1MB threshold for testing
```

**Monitored Metrics:**
- Total data transferred via DNS per process per hour
- Large DNS response patterns
- Unusual data volume patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration
```yaml
detectors:
  dns_anomaly:
    enabled: true
    max_queries_per_minute: 5
    max_queries_per_hour: 1000
    max_unique_domains_per_hour: 500
    data_exfiltration_threshold_mb_per_hour: 100
    base64_detection_threshold: 0.7
    entropy_threshold: 4.5
    txt_record_size_threshold: 512
    beaconing_detection_threshold: 0.8
```

### Advanced Configuration
```yaml

  # Known malicious domains (add your threat intelligence)
  known_malicious_domains:
    - "evil-domain.com"
    - "malware-c2.net"
  
  # Known C2 domains
  known_c2_domains:
    - "command-control.tk"
    - "beacon-server.ml"
  
  # Custom suspicious patterns (regex)
  suspicious_domain_patterns:
    - ".*\\.suspicious\\..*"
    - ".*[a-z0-9]{20,}\\.(tk|ml|ga|cf)$"
  
  # Alert frequency limits
  alert_frequency_limits:
    dns_tunneling:
      max_alerts_per_hour: 5
      cooldown_multiplier: 0.5
    high_volume_dns:
      max_alerts_per_hour: 3
      cooldown_multiplier: 0.7
    suspicious_domain:
      max_alerts_per_hour: 10
      cooldown_multiplier: 0.3
```

## üö® Smart Alert Deduplication

### Type-Based Alert Limits
The DNS anomaly detection engine includes sophisticated alert deduplication to prevent alert fatigue while maintaining security visibility:

```rust
// Different limits for different threat types
alert_frequency_limits:
  dns_tunneling:
    max_alerts_per_hour: 5
    cooldown_multiplier: 0.5
  high_volume_dns:
    max_alerts_per_hour: 3
    cooldown_multiplier: 0.7
  suspicious_domain:
    max_alerts_per_hour: 10
    cooldown_multiplier: 0.3
```

### Time-Based Tracking
- **Hourly Windows**: Alert frequency tracked in 1-hour sliding windows
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old alert timestamps automatically cleaned up
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory overhead for tracking

### Alert Flow Control
1. **Alert Generated**: Detector creates potential alert
2. **Type Classification**: Alert categorized by threat type
3. **Frequency Check**: Recent alerts for this type counted
4. **Threshold Decision**: Alert sent only if under threshold
5. **Timestamp Tracking**: Alert timestamp recorded for future checks

## üîß Implementation Details

### DNS Data Collection Methods

#### 1. System DNS Log Integration
```rust
// Parses systemd-resolved logs
journalctl -u systemd-resolved --since "5 seconds ago" -n 20 --no-pager

// Extracts domains from log patterns:
// "Looking up example.com"
// "Positive Trust Anchor for example.com"
```

#### 2. Process Command Line Analysis
```rust
// Reads /proc/{pid}/cmdline for domain extraction
// Useful for processes like curl, wget, browsers
```

#### 3. Network Connection Analysis
```rust
// Monitors DNS connections by:
// - Port 53 (UDP/TCP)
// - Port 853 (DNS over TLS)
// - Port 443 to known DNS providers (DoH)
// - Custom DNS ports (5353, 1053, 8053, 9053)
```

### High-Throughput Optimization

For busy networks, the engine uses non-blocking DNS monitoring:

```rust
// Fast, local operations only:
// 1. Quick /proc/{pid}/cmdline reads
// 2. Domain pattern matching
// 3. Basic metadata generation
// 4. No expensive system commands or log parsing
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **100 DNS connections**: ~100ms processing time
- **No system command spawning**
- **Minimal file system operations**
- **Memory-efficient processing**

### Domain Validation

RFC-compliant domain validation includes:
- Length validation (3-253 characters)
- Character validation (alphanumeric, dots, hyphens)
- Label validation (max 63 chars per label)
- TLD validation (min 2 chars, alphabetic)
