# EDR Agent - Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the EDR Agent's memory usage, CPU performance, and storage efficiency based on real-world testing on macOS.

## Memory Usage Analysis

### Runtime Memory Footprint

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **RSS (Physical Memory)** | 79-85 MB | Actual RAM usage during operation |
| **VSZ (Virtual Memory)** | ~412 MB | Virtual address space allocation |
| **Binary Size** | 5.0 MB | Compiled executable size |
| **CPU Usage** | 1.5-9.4% | During active monitoring periods |
| **Memory % of System** | 0.4-0.5% | Very low system impact |

### Memory Breakdown

#### Base Components (~57 MB)
- **Tokio Async Runtime**: ~15-20 MB (thread pools, task scheduling)
- **Event Buffers**: ~10-15 MB (in-memory event batching and processing)
- **File System Watcher**: ~8-12 MB (real-time file monitoring via notify crate)
- **Network Monitoring**: ~5-8 MB (connection tracking and process association)
- **Configuration & Logging**: ~3-5 MB (YAML config, structured logging)
- **Rust Runtime**: ~5-10 MB (allocator, standard library, core runtime)

#### Dynamic Components (~20-30 MB)
- **Event Processing**: Scales with system activity level
- **Compression Buffers**: Temporary allocation during gzip compression
- **System Snapshots**: Process and network state tracking

## Performance Characteristics

### CPU Usage Patterns
```
Idle State:          1.5-2%    (background monitoring)
Light Activity:      2-5%      (normal desktop usage)
Heavy Activity:      5-10%     (system under load)
Peak Processing:     Up to 15% (during event batching)
```

### Memory Scaling Factors
1. **System Activity Level**: More active processes increase memory usage
2. **File System Events**: High I/O operations require larger buffers
3. **Network Connections**: Many active connections increase tracking overhead
4. **Batch Size Configuration**: Larger event batches create higher memory peaks

## Storage Efficiency

### Compression Performance

| Test Scenario | Original Size | Compressed Size | Compression Ratio |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| High Activity | 594,496 bytes | 46,658 bytes | 92.2% reduction |
| Medium Activity | 67,288 bytes | 6,186 bytes | 90.8% reduction |
| Low Activity | 23,353 bytes | 2,710 bytes | 88.4% reduction |

### Storage Characteristics
- **Average Compression**: 85-95% size reduction
- **File Format**: Gzip-compressed JSON (.json.gz)
- **Typical Batch Size**: 2.6-6.2 KB per compressed file
- **Storage Growth**: 10 MB - 2 GB per day (depending on activity)

## Comparison with Industry Standards

## Performance Tuning

### Memory Optimization
```yaml
# Reduce memory usage
agent:
  max_events_per_batch: 500        # Default: 1000
  collection_interval_ms: 10000    # Default: 5000

collectors:
  process_monitor:
    scan_interval_ms: 2000         # Default: 1000
  file_monitor:
    max_file_size_mb: 50           # Default: 100
```

### Storage Optimization
```yaml
# Optimize storage efficiency
storage:
  local_storage:
    compress_events: true          # Always enable
  retention_days: 7                # Reduce for less storage
  max_storage_size_gb: 5           # Set storage limits
```

### CPU Optimization
```yaml
# Reduce CPU usage
collectors:
  process_monitor:
    scan_interval_ms: 5000         # Slower scanning
    collect_environment: false     # Skip env variables

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Resource Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor agent memory usage
ps -o pid,rss,vsz,pcpu,pmem,comm -p $(pgrep edr-agent)

# Monitor storage growth
du -sh data/ && ls -la data/ | wc -l

# Monitor compression efficiency
find data/ -name "*.gz" -exec sh -c 'original=$(zcat "$1" | wc -c); compressed=$(stat -f%z "$1" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$1"); echo "$(basename "$1"): $((100 - compressed * 100 / original))% compression"' _ {} \;
```

### Performance Alerts
